## Component Object Model (COM)

 is a platform-independent, distributed, object-oriented system for creating binary software components that can interact. COM is the foundation technology for Microsoft's OLE (compound documents), ActiveX (Internet-enabled components), as well as others.

## Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)

 DCOM is a programming construct that allows a computer to run programs over the network on a different computer as if the program was running locally

* `CLSID â€“ The Class Identifier (CLSID)` is a Global Unique Identifier (GUID). Windows stores a CLSID for each installed class in a program. When you need to run a class, you need the correct CLSID, so Windows knows where to go and find the program.
  * `oleview.exe` 

searching some COM Objects available and that can allows us to Execute code on the local machine.
